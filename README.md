Splits a block of text (e.g. copied from the bibliography section of a PDF article) into separate citations, sends each one to [a citation parser](https://github.com/hubgit/citation-parser), builds a PubMed search and displays the resulting citation.

Each extracted citation and PubMed query can be edited manually, if the citation is not matched automatically.
